# Lello

This is my first foray into Ember.js.

I tried to make good use of components and other Ember best practices. The only addons used are ember-modal-dialog and ember-cli-sass. Locally I used ember-cli.

Should run localy with no persistence (I run locally with ember-cli: "ember s"). Originally I tried to make this part of a Rails app but then decided to start over and just focus on the Ember part of it.
